- Only mads believe impressive things got their impressiveness based on complexity

- If you took too much time to understand a thing, it isn't only because of how your brain works
  it is also what causes your brain to work that way, free yourself.

- Science is art but humans over complicate this art.

- If adding a feature to a software overcomplicates it then the problem is not the feature, but
  you, every solution to a problem is simple!

- It is a lexury to be able to **needly** translate your thoughts into a piece of code

- The Web specification is an example of how immature people can think, we know them!

- Conventions and agreements on things are the keys to build software that solve a particular
  problem and promote compatibility but what if these conventions are bullshit?

- If the software you are building isn't a layer on top of another stupid abstraction then it
  is the opportunity to connect to your real art and build something beautiful, grab it!
